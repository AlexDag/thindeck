  Thindeck is using a pre-defined Docker image
  yegor256/thindeck, which runs Apache2 with PHP5, Perl,
  and Ruby pre-installed
---

`yegor256/thindeck` is our default Docker image that is
used for your web app, unless you have your own `Dockerfile`
in the root directory of your repository.

Our default Docker image start Apache2 HTTP Server with
PHP5 module enabled.

If you want to extend our image, use this template (as an example):

{% highlight bash %}
FROM yegor256/thindeck
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y ruby
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/apache2"]
CMD ["-D", "FOREGROUND"]
{% endhighlight %}
