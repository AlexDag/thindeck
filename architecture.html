      <h1>Architecture</h1>
      <p>This document specifies architecture and design decisions made in relation to
the Thindeck.com project.</p>

<p>Section 2 lists basic assumptions made after investigation of the provided
business case description. Section 3 includes two class diagrams showing the
packaging and class design. Section 4 explains separation of software
components, and the interaction between them and third-parties.
Section 5 describes a proposed physical layout of the major tiers of the
system under development (SuD). Section 6 gives internal details of major use
case implementations. Section 7 lists the three most severe technical risks
identified, analyzed, and planned. Section 8 lists all important technical
decisions made during architecture and design.</p>

<h2 id="2.-assumptions">2. Assumptions</h2>

<p>To be continued...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@todo #1/DES The specification is still rather vague for now. I haven&#39;t written
 any assumptions here just yet. Let&#39;s write them down here as they come up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="3.-class-diagrams">3. Class diagrams</h2>

<p>To be continued...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@todo #1/DES We should have a class diagram here. Ideally, we should have a tool
 that autogenerates the diagrams at deploy time from text data. However, we
 haven&#39;t decided yet on what this tool should be. Once that&#39;s been agreed
 upon, include the class diagrams right here.
@todo #1/DES Let&#39;s define the packaging structure of Thindeck. Describe the
 purposes of each package, the classes and resources that they contain, etc.
 Include a diagram showing how they are all related.</p>

<p>@todo #1/DES We need to identify the risks associated with this project. Let&#39;s
 document those risks in this section.</p>
